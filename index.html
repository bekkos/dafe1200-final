            <h2>Did you know?</h2>
            <p>
                Studies have shown that 1/3 of the food produced in the world is not eaten. 
                This is the reason why the UN's 12th sustainable development goal is targeting this issue.
                <br><br>
                In Norway 27% of all food waste is fruit and vegetables. We want to do something 
                about this and we need your help!

            <h3>What can we do?</h3>
            <p>
                We at Fruitly have teamed up with the biggest grocery stores in Norway to offer a 
                service that will notify you when there are fruits or vegetables that are about to 
                expire in the store. <br><br>
                You can then buy them for a cheaper price and save the environment at the same time!
