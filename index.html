            <p>
                According to the UN, one third of all food produced in the world ends up 
                rotting in bins of consumers and retailers <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/">(U.N&#128279;)</a>.
                
                <br><br>
                In Norway 27% of all food waste is fruit and vegetables 
                <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/safety/docs/fw_lib_format-rapport-2016-eng.pdf">(ForMat Project&#128279;)</a>.
                We want to do something about this and we need your help!

            <h3>What can we do?</h3>
            <p>
                We at Fruitly have teamed up with the biggest grocery stores in Norway to offer a 
                service that will notify you when there are fruits or vegetables that are about to 
                expire in the store. <br><br>
                You can then buy them for a cheaper price and save the environment at the same time!
