            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Fruitly was founded in 2020 by a team of six who all share a burning desire to 
                reduce food waste in the world. Our team consists of people from all around the 
                globe with different skills and experiences. We all come together in an effort 
                to help reduce food waste using mobile technology.
                <br><br>
                Fruitly aims to reduce food waste in the fruit and vegetable category and work 
                towards the UN sustainability goal 12. Our mission is to unify the public in an 
                effort to help reduce food waste. We want to make the app easy and accessible, 
                ensuring everyone can get access to good, healthy fruit and vegetables before 
                they are thrown away.
