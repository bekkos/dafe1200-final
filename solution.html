            <h2>Use Fruitly, save the world and money!</h2>
            <p>
                Fruitly is making it cheaper and easier to order baskets of fruit that the 
                grocery store otherwise would throw away. Our customers are either private 
                consumers or businesses that need extra energy and healthy food for a low price, 
                whilst also contributing to a more sustainable planet.
                <br><br>
                In addition we hope to reduce waste by including information and recipes that 
                utilizes fruit that you might not feel too inclined to eat. In our app you will 
                see a recipe section that includes recipes that we recommend. Our latest feature 
                is that you can share your own recipes and contribute to solutions to reduce 
                fruit waste. Every month for a year we will give out a Fruitly gift-card to the 
                most upvoted recipe of the month.
                <br><br>
                In our app you can order packages of different sizes containing different fruit. 
                This way we can ensure that you pick a size that fits your needs. 
                We have packages from mini-pack all the way to our special 10-pack. 
                (varies by local grocery store capacity)
