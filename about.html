            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Fruitly, A recent startup with a team of 6 who wants to tackle the problem of food waste. 
                Everyone in our team comes from different backgrounds and with different interests. 
                Together, we connected with the shared interest of the environment. 
                We have all seen how much food waste there actually is and therefore we wanted to 
                do something about it.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, In the middle of 2020, we started Fruitly.  Fruitly aims to reduce food 
                waste in the fruit and vegetable department and tackle the UN sustainability goal 12. 
                The idea of fruitly started because there is a huge amount of fruit and vegetables 
                thrown out or never made it to stores.
