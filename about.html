            <h1>Behind The App</h1>
            <p>
                Fruitly was founded in 2020 by a team of six who all share a burning desire to 
                reduce food waste in the world. Our team consists of people from all around the 
                globe with different skills and experiences. We all come together in an effort 
                to help reduce food waste using mobile technology.
                <br><br>
                Fruitly aims to reduce food waste in the fruit and vegetable category and work 
                towards the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12" target="_blank">UN sustainability goal 12.&#128279;</a> Our mission is to unify the public in an 
                effort to help reduce food waste. We want to make the app easy and accessible, 
                ensuring everyone can get access to good, healthy fruit and vegetables before 
                they are thrown away.

            <h2>Working towards a better future</h2>
            <p>
               "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns" <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">(U.N&#128279;)</a>  
                is the primary goal of the United Nation's 12th sustainability goal.
               <br><br>Target 12.3 reads like this; "By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer 
               levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest 
               losses" <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">(U.N&#128279;)</a> 

               <br><br>This is the target that we at Fruilty work towards and we hope that you 
               want to help us on the way by ordering fruit and vegetables from stores before they
               are thrown away.
